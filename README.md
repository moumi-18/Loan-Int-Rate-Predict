* Loan. Length -- Number of payments in months (36 or 60) 
* Loan. Purpose -- Reason for loan requests by customers
* Debt.To.Income.Ratio -- Its your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income
* Home. Ownership -- Customer/Borrower's Home ownership status: (RENT, OWN, MORTGAGE, OTHERS)
* Monthly. Income -- Monthly income of customer/borrower
* Open. CREDIT. Lines -- The number of open credit lines
* Revolving.CREDIT. Balance -- Type of credit Balance that can be used repeatedly up to a certain limit as long as the account is open, and payments are made on time. 
* Inquiries.in.the.Last.6.Months -- A credit inquiry is a request by an institution for credit report information from a credit reporting agency
